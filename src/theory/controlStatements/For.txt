It is the most common and widely used loop in Java. It is the easiest way to construct a loop structure in code as initialization of a variable, a condition and increment/decrement are declared only in a single line of code. It is easy to debug structure in Java.

Syntax:

for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement)
{
    statement;
}

Example:

class forLoopTest
{
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        for (int j = 1; j <= 5; j++)
            System.out.println(j);
    }
}

Output:

1
2
3
4
5
