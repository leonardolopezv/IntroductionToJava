Java Install
Some PCs might have Java already installed.

To check if you have Java installed on a Windows PC, search in the start bar for Java or type the following in Command Prompt (cmd.exe):
C:\Users\Your Name>java -version

If Java is installed, you will see something like this (depending on version):
java version "22.0.0" 2024-08-21 LTS
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment 22.9 (build 22.0.0+13-LTS)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 22.9 (build 22.0.0+13-LTS, mixed mode)
