-Print Text
Double Quotes
Text must be wrapped inside double quotations marks "".

If you forget the double quotes, an error occurs:

Example
System.out.println("This sentence will work!");
System.out.println(This sentence will produce an error);

-Print Numbers
You can also use the println() method to print numbers.

However, unlike text, we don't put numbers inside double quotes:

Example
System.out.println(3);
System.out.println(358);
System.out.println(50000);

You can also perform mathematical calculations inside the println() method:

Example
System.out.println(3 + 3);
System.out.println(2 * 5);
