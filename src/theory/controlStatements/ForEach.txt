For-Each loop is used to traverse through elements in an array. It is easier to use because we donâ€™t have to increment the value. It returns the elements from the array or collection one by one.

Example:

class foreachDemo{
 public static void main(String args[]){
   int a[] = {10,15,20,25,30};
    for (int i : a) {
        System.out.println(i);
    }
 }

Output:

10
15
20
25
30
