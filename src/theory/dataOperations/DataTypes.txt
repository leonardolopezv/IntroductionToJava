Primitive data types
Java data types are the kind of data you can store in a variable. Primitive data types are defined by the language itself. Java defines a total of eight primitive types. Of the eight primitive data types, six are for numbers, one is for characters, and one is for true/false values. Of the six number types, four are types of integers, and two are types of floating-point numbers.

Type    Wrapper Class   Parse Method of Wrapper Class
int     Integer            int parseInt(String s)
short   Short              short parseShort(String s)
long    Long</span>        long parseLong(String s)
byte    Byte               byte parseByte(String s)
float   Float              float parseFloat(String s)
double  Double             double parseDouble(String s)
char    Character          (none)
boolean Boolean            boolean parseBoolean(String s)

Math and NumberFormat classes
Java classes lay the foundation for your programs. The Java Math and NumberFormat classes let you program number values, as well as format numbers and currencies.

Method                      Description
num abs(num y);             Absolute value of y (num can be any numeric data type)
num max(num y, num z);      Maximum of y and z
num min(num y, num z);      Minimum of y and z
double = Math. random();    Random number, such that 0.0 < x <= 1.0

Method                      Description
NumberFormat
getNumberInstance();        Gets an instance that formats numbers.
NumberFormat                Gets an instance that formats currency.
String format(x);           Formats the specified number.
