Note: Java is case-sensitive: "MyClass" and "myclass" has different meaning.
The name of the java file must match the class name.

-The main Method
The main() method is required and you will see it in every Java program:
public static void main(String[] args)

-System.out.println()
Inside the main() method, we can use the println() method to print a line of text to the screen:
public static void main(String[] args) {
  System.out.println("Hello World");
}
